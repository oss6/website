This pen has seen the irascible, stringent hand.

The soft, joyous hopping between lines.

It has seen the weight of the numb hand.

The confused sentences.

The pauses ... the ... "what's accartocciare in inglese?" ... ah crumple.

Frustration.

Yes, the crumpling of its thoughts.

It has seen the naivety of past time verses.

The search of words, forms.

Frustration.

It asked to breathe. "No! You write! You breathe til I do".

It begged for silence, for another day to give way to the next, with His permission.
