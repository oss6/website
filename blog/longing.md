That is the pain of the heart.

In search of refuge it cries.

The eyes reveal.

The longing is plain for the world to see.

The wound is great.

Scared, it trembles.

Shieldless, it fears words.

For mercy, it begs.

Besieged by worries, it forgot to live.

Silence has overtaken.

The Compassionate gives it rest, protects it with the immense Love.
