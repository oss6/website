I don't usually jot down a yearly reflection, however, this year, I felt the need to collect my thoughts in here.
It'll be just a new day like many have passed, and many will pass, but as humans we like to partition things, to have a closure, and a start.

It's been a very hard year for many; who lost several relatives and friends, who is struggling with loneliness and mental health, who is struggling to put food on the table, who is already in a conflict zone with the virus lurking, who is continually faced with injustices, and more.

Personally, I lost my dear grandfather, a pillar in our family, may Allah have mercy on him. He always used to narrate the story of him going to Hajj (pilgrimage) in the 60s by car, from Marrakech to Mecca, passing through Algeria, Lybia, Egypt, Jerusalem, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and then going down to Madina and finally Mecca. One of his recurring advice was to stay steadfast in faith and every aspect of life. He was illiterate, started working at 6 years old (in the 1930s) but his wisdom was profound. His devotion, generosity, and kindness were permanent features throughout his life.
During summer holidays I remember the several visits to his spice shop in the old part of the city in Marrakech. My cousins and I were always welcomed with a big smile and a hot tea even if all the workers were busy.

Not being able to at least attend the funeral was devastating. My mother booked a flight to Morocco which was supposed arrive few days before he passed on. However, it was cancelled. I can't imagine the pain she went through.

In terms of mental health, I think that my anxiety and depression have surfaced, where in the past they were probably hidden.
During this year I developed IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) because of the amount of stress I went through. This started deteriorating my mental health: it was like a vicious cycle. There were days where I felt that I can't take it anymore; the physical and mental pain was excruciating.
I secluded myself from everyone, working was a struggle every single day, spiritually, physically, and mentally I stagnated.
Fortunately recently I've been feeling better, both physically and mentally, after coming to terms that I can't control everything, and talking through it.

On a positive note, I am grateful for finding a new job in this climate of uncertainty. I'm just grateful for having a roof over my head, food, and water. I am grateful to have a wonderful mother to share my thoughts and grief. I'm grateful to be able to have a warm shower. I'm grateful for everything despite everything else.

To brighter days, to collective healing, to hope, to realignment.
