Following the <a href="https://anticapitalistresistance.org/why-did-seid-visin-take-his-own-life/" target="_blank" class="link">heartbreaking suicide of former A.C. Milan academy player Seid Visin</a>, I kept pondering over the black and immigrant experiences in Italy.

"Now, wherever I go, wherever I am, wherever I am I feel on my shoulders, like a boulder, the weight of people's skeptical, prejudiced, disgusted and frightened looks," he wrote in the harrowing <a href="https://anticapitalistresistance.org/why-did-seid-visin-take-his-own-life/" target="_blank" class="link">letter</a> dated 2019, shedding light on the nature of the black experience in Italy.

As a child of immigrant Moroccan parents, I related to the recounts of navigating racism in Italy and wanted to re-explore what I buried for a long time or never dealt with.

I was born in Morocco and when I was 2 years old we moved to Italy, in the Trentino Alto-Adige region in the north of Italy. My "first encounter" with racism and the feeling of exclusion was in primary school; I was the only brown person and I was one of two kids with immigrant parents in my class. I clearly recall the day when a teacher asked us what we wanted to become when we grew up and when my friend replied, the teacher shook her head while grinning, following with a sarcastic "sure".

Throughout primary school I only remember instances of direct and blunt racism and exclusion; I can't imagine or recall the countless subtle remarks. At that time political parties with anti-immigration, nationalist components (such as Lega Nord) were on the rise. Moreover the immigrant population had doubled in just 4 years from 2002 and 2006 <a href="#references" class="link">(1)</a> and the refugee population had seen a steep increase between 2010 and 2014 <a href="#references" class="link">(2)</a>. Alongside this political spectrum, there was an increase of fascism/Mussolini nostalgia which found a thriving ground in schools. All this created an atmosphere of ardent adversity towards immigrants.

Racism in Italy is quite different from the UK, for example. In Italy black and brown people are grouped under common umbrella terms such as "negro" or even "marocchino" (Moroccan). Moreover the discrimination is much more blunt and direct and the indifference to it is quite evident.

As Nadeesha Uyangoda reported, "the main difference between Europe and the US is that for a long time Europeans practiced their racism abroad. In Italy, systemic racism isn't rooted in segregation, as it is in the US, but in colonialism and, more recently, immigration" <a href="#references" class="link">(3)</a>.
In fact, Italy is unwilling to deal with its colonial past. For example, in history curriculums, fascism's atrocities are included only when the receiver end are Italians (e.g. partisans). However, the brutal colonisation of Libya and Ethiopia is rarely discussed, watering down the conversation to a mere military conquests.

Hence the quite evident nostalgia towards Mussolini's fascist "Italian Empire". Personally I experienced classmates chanting fascist hymns on an almost daily basis for at least 2 years in middle school.
On an emotional level, I always felt the need to conform with my white Italian peers to the extent I started to feel disgust towards immigrants in general, and subsequently disassociating myself from them. Nonetheless, unsurprisingly, I found that discrimination did not stop. As Seid Visin recounted in his letter, it feels like you're constantly carrying a burden.

The atmosphere was also fuelled by the discursive stereotypes that emanate from right-wing political parties which were constantly reiterated by school kids: portraying the immigrant or the children of immigrants as inclined towards criminality, dirty, and repugnant.

On an institutional level, Italy's lack of action to address the long-standing systemic racial inequalities was especially evident after the widespread protests demanding justice for the victims of police brutality and racial discrimination in June 2020. This is because in Italy there is a collective sentiment that racism is not a issue, let alone an institutional one.
In fact policymakers have never seriously addressed the issue of structural racial inequalities which is compounded by the fact that in Italy there are no political forces that have a clear understanding of the issue <a href="#references" class="link">(4)</a>. Moreover, this can be seen from the lack of relevant and independent data and statistics about hate crimes and racial discrimination.

The experience that I and many "second generation" children is resembling one of visbility and invisiblity at the same time. Visibility in the sense that within the society you're classified and labelled, which in turns makes any actions or inactions from your side be attributed to the whole classification. On the other hand, the invisibility manifests itself into the collective life; since we're seen as "outsiders", we do not deserve our voices to be heard, therefore making us invisible when it comes to national discourses.

Seid Visin, rest in peace and power.
