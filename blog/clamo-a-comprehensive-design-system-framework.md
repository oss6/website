Design systems serves as a bridge between designers and frontend developers.
As web applications grow, more and more components are developed, and a need to have common components and principles becomes evident.

Design systems are comprise of at least 3 parts [\[1\]](#design-systems-for-developers):

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li>Common reusable UI components</li>
  <li>Foundation elements: colours, spacing, typography</li>
  <li>Documentation: usage instructions, principles, best practices etc...</li>
</ul>

Just like any type of system, a design system is always evolving which requires testing, validation, and discoverability to be in place.

It's with these points in mind that I started <a href="https://github.com/oss6/clamo">clamo</a>, a comprehensive design system framework which allows developers and designers to agree on a design system specification and clamo will generate the common reusable UI components, foundation elements, and the necessary documentation.
It will also be intended to allow for testing the system, validate usages against it, and ways to distribute it.

Clamo is in active development, stay tuned for more updates.
