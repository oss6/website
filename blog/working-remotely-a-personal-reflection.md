As remote working became the standard way of working for many industries since the start of the pandemic, many people, teams, and companies had to adjust their ways of working.
This meant that traditional ways of communication, collaboration, and team dynamics had to be revisited. However, remote working is not merely moving traditional working practices to digital platforms. A successful approach should factor in the disparate environments, personal circumstances, and above all the current pandemic and its effects.

Therefore I am going to split this article into four thematic areas:

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li>Communication</li>
  <li>Collaboration</li>
  <li>Working hours</li>
  <li>Personal well-being</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communication</h2>

I would say this is one of the most important aspect of remote. It's not so much the medium used but the way teams communicate efficiently without causing a strain on individuals. In regards to meetings, many companies merely transfer them to the "new" way of working. This inevitably will incur in virtual-meeting fatigue which is a consequence of need to work harder to process non-verbal cues like facial expressions, the tone and pitch of the voice, and body language; paying more attention to these consumes a lot of energy <a href="#references" class="link">[1]</a>.

Ways to reduce the fatigues from my experience and backed by research, including a study by Microsoft <a href="#references" class="link">[2]</a>, include:

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li>Limiting meetings to 30 minutes, maximum 40.</li>
  <li>Take regular breaks during long meetings.</li>
  <li>Have a clear agenda before the meeting.</li>
</ul>

Another important aspect, is to ensure that you know yours and your colleagues' preferred method of communication. If someone prefers text over video calls do not bother them with constant requests of video calls. Moreover respecting one's colleague's non-working time is crucial, for example do not send a message during out of work hours; if it's urgent email is the best tool. Therefore keeping a calendar for activities other than meetings is a good way to inform people of your availability.

<h2>Collaboration</h2>

Personally, remote collaboration has been somewhat a challenge. Mainly because I prefer face-to-face collaboration where you can share ideas more easily.
Specifically for software developers, pair-programming is a different experience remotely; the impact of virtual-meeting fatigue is felt in this setting as well.

Personally, I follow these guidelines when collaborating (it can be expanded to other fields):

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li>Have shorter collaboration sessions with a clear agenda.</li>
  <li>Choose a collaboration tool that works efficiently for your team. I can recommend <a href="https://miro.com/" class="link">Miro</a> for planning activities.</li>
  <li>Set recurring reviews of objectives (if working in an Agile manner there are the usual ceremonies).</li>
  <li>Set recurring knowledge sharing sessions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working hours</h2>

Working in a traditional 9-5 setting, I noticed that not every hour is spent on the actual work at hand (e.g. working on a feature/bug).
This has been more evident when working remotely, since the boundaries of work-home are blurred.
In my personal experience, the core working hours are usually of 4/5 hours. The rest are administrative tasks, such as reading/replying to emails, meetings, webinars and so forth, which can be reduced, making the traditional 9-5 settings irrelevant.
Moreover with **distributed teams** the issue is one of coordinating covering hours and meetings.

I would go as far as saying that 5 days a week is outdated (at least for software development, unless you're on support in critical hours). Some factors that make the traditional way of working obsolete are:

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li>Motivation decreases throughout the week <a href="#references" class="link">[3].</a></li>
  <li>Productivity and output don't decrease with less days and spread out work.</li>
  <li>Personally (a software developer in a non-managerial position) I feel like the amount of work usually runs out by Friday.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal well-being</h2>

This point is specifically important in the case of the current pandemic, instead of a generic working from home setting.
Since the work/home lines are blurred and for many this is the first time working remotely in a full-time manner,
some people (myself included), tend to work more outside the core hours.

A way I personally use to disconnect from work when it's time is to set an alarm 15 minutes before 5pm (or 4pm if I wake up at 8am), as well as finishing any work half an hour prior to disconneting.
Moreover I try to have a walk at lunch time, this helps decluttering my mind and being ready for the "second half".
