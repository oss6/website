Working on multiple projects is not ideal. In fact the overhead of context switching grows with the number of projects being worked on.

</div>

However, certain settings, such as science institutions and universities, require working on multiple workstreams.

Personally, I manage multiple projects keeping in mind these 3 key areas:

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li><strong>Schedule</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Tracking</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Triggers</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Schedule - creating focus streams</h2>

<strong>Tool(s)</strong>: calendar, Trello

Not a tight schedule, nor no schedule at all: a simple schedule of the work that will be done throughout the day is essential.
Practically I either prepare it the day before or in the morning. I put slots of 1 hour for each project (or 2, it's not fixed). I usually work on one project in the morning and one in the afternoon; I don't interleave in order to minimise context switching.

The schedule is not too tight/granular; this is to allow for changes and adaptation.

Now let's consider the example when a priority task comes in which is related to a different project I'm currently working on. In this case, depending on how long it takes, I either continue working on the switched on project or switch back to the previous one. I find this to help with minimising the context switching side effects.

<h2>Tracking - knowing what has been done and what should be done</h2>

<strong>Tool(s)</strong>: Trello

For each project's task I keep track of the things that should be done as part of the acceptance criteria.

<div class="my-4">
  <img src="/images/blog/how-i-manage-multiple-projects/tracking.png">
</div>

I keep different sections for each task/workstream (see figure above):

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li><strong>Today</strong> - these are the tasks I'll be working on throughout the day</li>
  <li><strong>Backlog</strong> - this is the overall backlog of tasks to be worked on; useful for keeping an eye on how much needs to be done</li>
  <li><strong>Archive</strong> - tasks that are done; useful for revisiting a task that may have not been resolved for example</li>
  <li><strong>Workstreams</strong> - general overview of the workstreams within different projects; this maintains the vision of the projects clear</li>
</ul>

<h2>Triggers - useful cues to minimise the overhead of context switching</h2>

<strong>Tool(s)</strong>: Trello, Chrome group tabs, specific tools (such as bookmarks in IDEs)

Triggers are a combination of project-specific cues that help me continue where I left off: checklists, opened tabs in IDEs (Integrated Development Environment), tab groups in Chrome for tasks, etc...

These are useful to get a sense of familiarity on the task I was working on, after not having worked on it for a long time (1/2 weeks for example).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

To conclude, I would like to emphasise that these are just personal indicative points, guidelines, not hard rules. Obviously one has to be always flexible and keep room for sudden changes in requirements.
