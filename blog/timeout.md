Many sports have the timeout concept in which a team
asks for a brief pause to reorganise their tactics, catch a
breath, and generally change the tempo of the game.
They usually happen in a critical situation, for instance when the losing
team is only one point behind with 40 seconds to go.

As humans we also need timeouts in several stages of our life to
regain focus and readjust awareness. My timeout call came
during a critical time in my life. As I was concluding the
third year at university, I felt the accumulation of several
parallel worries/events turn into a sense of confusion,
numbness, apathy, and spiritual stagnation.

Not aware of what was going on, I alienated myself, crawled into
a sort of darkness. I felt social interactions to be a huge
burden. Many times, to suppress this feeling, I would make
myself busy, in vain.
The passion for drawing I have almost faded; I couldn't keep the
flame burning. Losing interest in everything, I found it hard to
enjoy the little things in life. The result was an irascible,
individual, living in the past and worrying about the future.
Any attempt to start something that might "ingnite me" died quickly.

At this point I thought a timeout may be vital. I guess solitude (not loneliness)
helped introspecting myself and arriving at this conclusion.
And here I am, taking the first step on this journey, ready to get back
into the game.

Stay tuned for more posts!
