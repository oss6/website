<h2>Overview</h2>

Web development is the process of building content and applications to distribute through the web (or intranet).
In a nutshell, web development may be comprised of two main layers: frontend and backend.

Frontend is what the user sees, the interface, the components that make up a page.

Backend, on the other hand, includes the business logic and processes any requests coming from the user.

Depending on the requirements, a backend may be absent, for example when building a simple static landing page.

Both "areas" include many different frameworks, libraries, and tools to choose from.
This article, however, will explore the concepts in a platform-independent way.

You may wonder whether you need a computer science degree to pursue a web development career. Although one can be beneficial, you don't actually need a CS degree. However, being aware of general fundamental computer science concepts is useful.

<h2>Components of a web application</h2>

In order to understand where to start, we need to explore the anatomy of a standard web application.

<h3>Presentation layer</h3>

The presentation layer corresponds to the user interface where the user interacts with the web application.
The frontend is comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for the structure of the page, the styling, and the interactivity respectively.

Usually developers choose a framework (such as Angular, React, Vue) to manage the complexity of the UI.

<h3>Business logic layer</h3>

This layer is responsible for processing the requests from the user in accordance with the business logic constraints put in place.

<h3>Data access layer</h3>

In the data access layer information is stored and retrieved from a database or file system.

<h2>Where to start?</h2>

There are many resources on the internet regarding web development, from beginner courses to advanced tutorials.
The challenge is to navigate through the vast amount of frameworks and tools that are available.

Following is a "learning path" diagram for frontend web development that _may_ work for you:

<iframe style="width: 100%" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/o9J_lHmdNyU=/?moveToViewport=-1177,-427,1932,1088" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>

The diagram starts with an overview of general computer science concepts such as algorithms and data structures.
Then an understanding of how the web works is necessary for web development.
Finally you can delve into the major components/languages of web development, namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

After gaining a basic understanding of the building blocks of web development, you can choose a frontend framework which will abstract the way applications are built with pure JavaScript.

The diagram contains <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> as a framework for frontend web applications, however one can use any available frameworks out there (<a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a>, etc...).
